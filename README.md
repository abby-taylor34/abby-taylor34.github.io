# Work's Website - Abby Taylor

Welcome to my Works website GitHub repository. This is an open source, good for skimming off of for your own website! Using GitHub Pages, there are formatted and deployed pages including my portfolio type website. 

# About Me

You will find a nice about me page on the site, but a brief overview is below:

_My name is Abby Taylor and I am a current junior, graduating in May 2027, from Iowa State Univeristy! My time at the university has been encapsulated with my double major in Computer Science and Criminal Justice, my time as an IT Student Worker for the Department of Economics, the ever-changing life as a Resident Assistant for the Department of Residence, and my newly acquired Research Assistant position with the Psycho-Legal Experiments and Applications Lab here on campus! Outside of my large variety of activites, I hangout with my friends and girlfriend all around campus, read, play video games, and do some random art/wire art on the side! My educational background is diverse with both research in criminology ideals and extensive coding projects which includes Mimicry: the mobile game developed by me and my friends during Fall Semester of 2025.

I currently am going to be with Federated Insurance based in Owatonna, Minnesota this coming 2026 summer! By participating in their Information Systems Intern program, I am hoping to garner lots of relevant experience in real-world applications and create some exciting features!_

# What will you find?

In the site, there will be works from all of the following: personal projects, Computer Science coursework, Criminal Justice coursework, and research work. 

I will also make a point to post in a blog type format for updates on coming projects, items, etc.
